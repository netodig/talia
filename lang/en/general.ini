DIARIO="Pregnancy scheduler"
DIARIO_EXPLICACION="The pregnancy scheduler is a tool you can use to stamp daily all changes and sensations you will realise in your body since the first day you'll get the announcement.

PREGUNTAS="Questions for the doctor"
PREGUNTAS_EXPLICACION="You will be able to write down all the questions that may arise, and you can save them all together, so that you can ask everything to your gynecologist on your appointment. If you want to, you can anonymously post not only the question, but also the answer given by the medical specialist. You will have to keep in mind that every person and pregnancy is different. Therefore, these questions and answers are for guidance purposes only, they will never be considered as a treatment to be followed."
